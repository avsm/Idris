<h1>Idris</h1>

<h2>A language with dependent types &mdash; crash course</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.st-and.ac.uk/~eb/Idris">Idris</a> is an
experimental functional programming language with full
dependent types. This tutorial is intended as a brief introduction to
the language, and is aimed at readers already familiar with a
functional language such as Haskell or OCaml. In particular, a certain
amount of familiarity with Haskell syntax is assumed, although most concepts
will at least be explained briefly.
</p>

<p>
Idris is very much a work in progress, and new features are being
added all the time. As a result, there are always likely to be
features which are not documented here, although I will do my best to
keep it up to date.
</p>

<h4>What are dependent types?</h4>

<p>
<em>Dependent types</em> allow types to be predicated
on <em>values</em>. For example, rather than giving a type <code>List
Int</code> for lists of integers, we could be more precise and give a
type <code>List Int n</code> for lists of integers of
length <code>n</code>. As we will see throughout the tutorial, this
allows us to give much more precise types to programs, and even to
prove certain properties of programs.
</p>

<h4>Contents</h4>

<p>
The tutorial consists of a number of example programs with detailed
explanations. Each of the following chapters is generated from an
Idris source file, so that you can download each one and experiment.
