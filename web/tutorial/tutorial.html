<h1>Idris</h1>

<h2>A language with dependent types &mdash; crash course</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.st-and.ac.uk/~eb/Idris">Idris</a> is an
experimental functional programming language with full
dependent types. This tutorial is intended as a brief introduction to
the language, and is aimed at readers already familiar with a
functional language such as Haskell or OCaml. In particular, a certain
amount of familiarity with Haskell syntax is assumed, although most concepts
will at least be explained briefly.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial is, at present, more of a "crash course", intended to
cover as many features as quickly as possible. Hopefully over time it
will grow and include more detailed illustrative examples. Suggestions
for improvements (e.g. more examples, more details, exercises) are
welcome, and since the tutorial is in the darcs repository,
suggestions for improvements with patches are even more welcome.
</p>

<p>
Idris is very much a work in progress, and new features are being
added all the time. As a result, there are always likely to be
features which are not documented here, although I will do my best to
keep it up to date.
</p>

<h4>What are dependent types?</h4>

<p>
<em>Dependent types</em> allow types to be predicated
on <em>values</em>. For example, rather than giving a type <code>List
Int</code> for lists of integers, we could be more precise and give a
type <code>List Int n</code> for lists of integers of
length <code>n</code>. As we will see throughout the tutorial, this
allows us to give much more precise types to programs, and even to
prove certain properties of programs.
</p>

<h4>Contents</h4>

<p>
The tutorial consists of a number of example programs with
explanations. Each of the following chapters is generated from an
Idris source file, so that you can download each one and experiment.
