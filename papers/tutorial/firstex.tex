\section{First Examples}

In this section, we'll write a couple of quick (and hopefully
familiar) programs to show how to evaluate expressions and compile
programs. Then, we'll build a complete (if simple) application to
illustrate some of the basic language features.

\subsection{Hello world}

To get things going, let's implement everyone's favourite first
example, the ``Hello World'' program. If you are familiar with
Haskell, not much of this will be surprising. Put the following in a
file called \texttt{hello.idr}:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{hworld}

main : IO ();
main = putStrLn "Hello world!";

\end{SaveVerbatim}

\useverb{hworld}

prelude.idr. Primitive types.

\subsection{Data types}

Lists (Haskell style declartions), do map and fold, and some evaluation at the \Idris{} prompt.

\subsection{Vectors}

Pairwise addition of vectors.

\subsection{Dependent Pairs}

Users tend not to be so helpful at providing well formed inputs. So
although we can add vectors of the same length, a user might not
provide two vectors of the same length.

vadd'

\subsection{Informative Testing}


Summary: vadd does the work, but we're not allowed to run it until we
can satisfy the machine that we've done the relevant checks.
