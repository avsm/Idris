\section{Introduction}

\Idris{} is a functional programming language with full dependent
types. It is similar to \Epigram~\cite{view-left} or
\Agda{}~\cite{ulf-thesis}, in that it supports dependent pattern
matching. It is built on top of the \Ivor{}~\cite{ivor} theorem
proving library, and is a pure functional language with a syntax
similar to Haskell with GADTs.  The purpose of the language is to
provide a platform for practical programming with dependent types.

We have used our own implementation, rather than an
existing tool, as this gives complete freedom to experiment with
abstractions and language features beyond the type system, such as I/O
and concurrency. Additionally, although unrelated to the work we
present in this paper, the core language is intended as an important
step towards a fully dependently typed implementation of
Hume~\cite{Hume-GPCE}.

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We show that a practical, realistic and efficient dependently
  typed programming language can be built with existing technology.
\item We give an implementation of an I/O monad using dependent types,
  in the style of Hancock and Setzer~\cite{hancock-interactive}, which
  compiles to C, and allows foreign functions (implemented in C) to be
  executed without requiring any extensions to the language or type
  system.
\item We exploit the fact that \Idris{} is built on top of a tactic
  based theorem prover, \Ivor{}~\cite{ivor}, to show how programming
  considerations and proof obligations can be neatly separated.
\end{enumerate}
