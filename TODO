* Collapsible data structures.
   - Translate to unit.
   - Implement non-linear pattern matching.
   - Auto generated 'build' function, a partial function which
     constructs an instance of a collapsible type, given
     indices. Likely to rely on non-linear matching. Such functions
     must be compile time only.
      + Have a way of marking functions as compile time metaprograms
        only. So they can be used to generate programs, but not run,
        and probably shouldn't be allowed in types.
   - tactic which automatically builds instances of collapsible
     functions where possible.
