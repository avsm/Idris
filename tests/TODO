Tests currently cover:

* basic stuff
* with rule (basic use of it)
* sigma types
* proofs
* constructing and specialising dsl interpreters

Need tests for:

* type errors
* failed proofs
* operator sections
* provisional definitions

... and a quicker way of loading include files to speed up the tests
would be nice!
... also allow multiple commands to be executed in batch mode from the
same instance.
